function getAge(){
document.write("Born in Year:  " + (2022 - myPrompt));
}

var myPrompt = prompt("What is your age?");
console.log(myPrompt);

todayYear = start.getYear();
//was thinking i could use  var todayYear = start.getYear(); to to todayyear - myPrompt but it leads me to a error where it shows nothing
//document.write("Your birth year is " + Number(todayYear) - Number(myPrompt));} was thinking along those lines
